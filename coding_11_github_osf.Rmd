# GitHub

First make a GitHub repository, then an R Studio project with version control.

Making a GitHub project requires a GitHub account and from there you can create a new repository. For  scientific project that will become a (published) paper, I would make it public and give it a GPL 3 license to keep it Open Access in all future forms.

At some point before making an R Studio project that is connected to the GitHub repository, you need to install `git` on your computer. When installing `git` it will want to be associated with a text editor. You should pick one you like, or at least know how to use, because sooner or later you will probably need to use for something that R Studio doesn't (yet) do with some fancy buttons. I like Atom, but you should pick whatever you like.


# Version controlled R Studio project


In order to directly contribute to someone else's GitHub project, you need to first fork their project. Then also declare the "upstream" repo somewhere, in your local git version of the project.

When you type:

```{bash}
git remote -v
```

Into the R Studio Terminal tab, you should get a list of the branches of your git project. There are usually at least two sources, each on their own line. If you didn't link your repo to an upstream git repo yet, those lines start with 'origin'.

You can then add the upstream repository with this command:

```{bash}
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
```

Replace the URL with the actual URL for the upstream repository.

If this command completes successfully, the earlier command `git remote -v` should now also have some lines that start with 'upstream'.

Now git is ready to pull in changes from the upstream repository. First, we get a fresh copy of the upstream repository:

```{bash}
git fetch upstream
```

And switch to the local branch (in this case 'master') that we want the upstream changes to be reflected in:

```{bash}
git checkout master
```

And then we can merge the upstream master with the local master:

```{bash}
git merge upstream/master
```

If some changes need to be committed first and you run this from command line, git will drop you into it's standard text editor to write the commit message.

By default this is `vim` which works very differently from what you may be used to. In particular, everything works with keyboard shortcuts. In this case, you can simply edit the one line for the commit message, and then press `Esc` and then `:wq` to save the file and exit `vim`.

# Open Science Framework

The Open Science Framework (OSF) plays a role that GitHub can not.

You can register projects. Registered projects can't be altered anymore. This guarantees to your readers that you didn't tamper with data files or code after publication.

You can also get a DOI for your data and code so that you can always show that you did something first.

Pick the Canadian file server.
