When calculating an AIC or related metric, one important ingredient is the number of **independent** observations. This might seem straightforward, but isn't always the case. When are observations truly independent? Below, we'll revisit the two-rate model and see how to get the number of independent observations (or effective sample size) for a time series. 

# Two-Rate and One-Rate model

In this section we will compare two models fit to the same data.
